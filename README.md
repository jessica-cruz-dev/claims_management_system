# Claims Management System

For some of my time At IHME, I worked on the Resource Tracking - Disease Expenditures team where
I processed large amounts of claims data from differently formatted datasets to be used in producing 
spending estimates at the county-level by health condition, age, sex, and type of care, from 1996 to 2019.

Administrative data related to health insurance claims is extremely powerful for driving
improvements in population health to address issues related to cost, quality, and outcomes.
Health care is a data-intense industry (https://www.ruralcenter.org/)

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) data include information at the patient encounter level
regarding diagnoses, treatments, and billed and paid amounts.

One challenge related to using claims is assessing data quality and accounting for incomplete or missing data.

I'm creating a mock claims data management application to represent how claims data is imputed, processed, and reported on
in a hospital setting. 


Future goals for expansion:
- Converting claims into unique visit
- Identifying incomplete claims data
- Categorizing providers and locations of service
